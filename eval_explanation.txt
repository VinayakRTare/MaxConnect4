findBestPlay():
This method plays a piece on the board using alpha beta pruning using depth limited search
This method takes current game board state as input.
For each valid column it calls MaxValue/MinValue depending upon the player.
MaxValue()/MinValue(): takes 4 parameters gameboard, depthlevel, alpha, beta
It uses alpha beta pruning but each time reduces depthlevel by 1.

MaxValue() and MinValue() runs until depth level becomes 0.
After that It returns value to findBestPlay() function. This value is used to determine column number the AiPlayer would like to play in.
